## Sample running a sketch with a loop, math and LED blink:

https://lrusso.github.io/ArduinoSimulator/ArduinoSimulatorSample.htm?pinled=13

## How to set a default sketch in the simulator?

Edit the **STRING_WELCOME** variable located in **ArduinoSimulator.htm** file.

## How to set a different pin for the LED light?

Browse to the Web page with a different **pinled** value (see example above) or change the **myPinLed** variable in the **ArduinoSimulator.js** file.

## Roadmap

* Boolean to bool implementation.

* pulseIn implementation.

* String class implementation.
